# iSPA CMS (Laravel 9.x + Vite [Vue3 Typescript] + TailwindCss)

This is my personal project to learn Laravel 9.x, Vite (Vue3 Typescript) and TailwindCss.
You guys can use this project as a boilerplate for your project.
If you have any question, please feel free to contact me.

The roadmap is:

- [ ] Init the code (Backend + Frontend)
- [ ] Enumerate type + Enumerate -> first of things
- [ ] Audit logs for actions in admin control
- [ ] Login screen + User information
- [ ] Permission + User Roles
- [ ] Website language
- [ ] Translate keys + generate file lang (php + json)
- [ ] Settings table
- [ ] Menu management
- [ ] Slugs + SEO tables
- [ ] Categories management
- [ ] Upload media + Media library management
- [ ] Metadata management
- [ ] Posts/Article management
... and more (I will update later)
